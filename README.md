# dockerweb
I have created a DOCKER WEB UI from where we can access all docker container commands.
And the amazing thing is we are getting output of the docker commands on the same page without reloading the page. 
Even if we make any changes to the file , we don't have to reload the page just save the file and it will automatically detect the changes made.
This is all possible because of the great concept AJAX.
